Puzzle platformer written in [rust][rust-lang] using the [piston][piston] game framework.

Currently has working physics and multiple level loading! There is also a level editor, but it does not yet save to level files.

As I am not very much of a game artist, all player animations were created by Seth Galbraith, and are available via [opengameart][hacknslash].

The menu font, Akashi, is used from [tenbytwenty.com][akashi] with permission.
