Puzzle platformer written in [rust][rust-lang] using the [piston][piston] game framework.

Currently has working physics and multiple level loading! There is also a level editor, but it does not yet save to level files.

All physics constants can currently be adjusted by a gtk widget which runs alongside the actual game.

As I am not very much of a game artist, all player animations were created by Seth Galbraith, and are available via [opengameart][hacknslash].
